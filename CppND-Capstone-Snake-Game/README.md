# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game Example

This is a starter repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses

The Capstone Project gives you a chance to integrate what you've learned throughout this program. This project will become an important part of your portfolio to share with current and future colleagues and employers.

In this project, you can build your own C++ application or extend this Snake game, following the principles you have learned throughout this Nanodegree Program. This project will demonstrate that you can independently create applications using a wide range of C++ features.

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 3.7
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* SDL2 >= 2.0
  * All installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation)
  >Note that for Linux, an `apt` or `apt-get` installation is preferred to building from source. 
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./SnakeGame`.

## Rubric Points

1. The project reads and writes from external files - 

  Obstacle.cpp Line 8 - Function created to read coordinates from external .txt file.  These coordinates are used to construct an obstacle in SDL game window
  Game.cpp - Line 104-152 -  Functions created to read/write the high scores and names to .txt files


2. The project accepts user input and processes the input

  Main.cpp Line 37 -  User name input take from terminal to store user name.  User name is processed and later output to terminal displaying username with highest score. 


3. The project uses Object Oriented Programming techniques 

  Obstacle.h Line 15 - 35  Obstacle Class was created and used throughout the Snake Game program


4. The project makes use of references in function declarations 

  Game.h Lines 24 & 26 -  Functions use pass-by-reference 


5. The project makes use of smart pointers

  Game.h Line 30 -  Shared pointer declared
  Game.cpp Line 16 - memory allocated 

6. The project uses multiple threads in the execution

  Game.cpp Lines 69-71 - Multithreading used to check random food coordinates against snake body points and obstacle points
